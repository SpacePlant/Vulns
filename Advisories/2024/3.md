# 2024-3: Splashtop Streamer
## Description
The MSI installer for Splashtop Streamer for Windows versions < 3.6.2.0 uses a temporary folder with weak permissions during installation. A local authenticated user can exploit this to escalate privileges to `SYSTEM`.
## CVE
CVE-2024-42051
## CVSS
Base score: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
## Details
If the MSI installer still exists in the original location it was executed from, or it was originally executed from a location it can be copied back to, a regular user can force a reinstall of the product. During reinstall, a `.reg` file (`InstRegExp.reg`) is loaded from a user-writable folder in the user's `%TEMP%` directory. A local authenticated user can delete the `SetupUtil.exe` executable (to prevent it from deleting the `.reg` file) and place a `.reg` file with that name in the folder. The file will be loaded in the `SYSTEM` context, and any keys and values defined in it will be written to the registry. This can be used to write a `Debugger` value to the `Image File Execution Options` registry key for a binary that runs as `SYSTEM` and point it to an arbitrary binary that will be executed instead.
