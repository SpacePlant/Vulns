# 2024-4: Splashtop Streamer
## Description
The MSI installer for Splashtop Streamer for Windows versions < 3.7.0.0 uses a temporary folder with weak permissions during installation. A local authenticated user can exploit this to escalate privileges to `SYSTEM`.
## CVSS
Base score: 7.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
## Details
If the MSI installer still exists in the original location it was executed from, or it was originally executed from a location it can be copied back to, a regular user can force a reinstall of the product. During reinstall, a `.reg` file (`CredProvider_Inst.reg`) is loaded from a user-writable folder in the user's `%TEMP%` directory. A local authenticated user can set an oplock on the file and then overwrite it repeatedly with arbitrary contents after the oplock has been triggered. If the race condition is won, the file will be loaded in the `SYSTEM` context, and any keys and values defined in it will be written to the registry. This can be used to write a `Debugger` value to the `Image File Execution Options` registry key for a binary that runs as `SYSTEM` and point it to an arbitrary binary that will be executed instead.
